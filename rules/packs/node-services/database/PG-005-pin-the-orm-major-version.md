rationale: Prisma 7 and Prisma 8 use different migration commands, and Prisma 8 is the npm default while still a release candidate.

Read the installed ORM version from the lockfile before running any migration or schema command, and use that version's commands. Prisma 7 applies migrations with `prisma migrate deploy`; Prisma 8 uses `prisma db migrate`, `prisma migration plan`, and `prisma migration check`. Do not upgrade the ORM's major version as part of another change.
