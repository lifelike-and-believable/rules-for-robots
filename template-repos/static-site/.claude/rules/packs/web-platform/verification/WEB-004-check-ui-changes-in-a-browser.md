title: Check UI changes in a real browser
level: SHOULD
scope: pack:web-platform

verified-by: [review]
targets-failure: unverified-claim
observed-on: []
rationale: Type checks and unit tests do not show layout, focus, or rendering problems, and browser accessibility snapshots cost far fewer tokens than screenshots.

After changing UI, load the affected page in a browser with the Playwright CLI (prefer it to the Playwright MCP server in long sessions, because it uses about a quarter of the tokens), exercise the changed interaction, and run axe on it. Report what you checked. Keep screenshots for visual questions; use accessibility snapshots otherwise.
