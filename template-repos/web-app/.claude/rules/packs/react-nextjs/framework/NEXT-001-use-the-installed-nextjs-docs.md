rationale: Next.js 16 changed defaults that models trained on older versions get wrong, and version-matched docs ship inside the package.

Before using a Next.js API, read its page in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` for the installed version. Current defaults to remember: request interception lives in `proxy.ts` (`middleware.ts` is deprecated but still needed for the Edge runtime); `fetch` is not cached unless you opt in; `use cache` requires `cacheComponents` in `next.config`; request APIs such as `cookies()`, `headers()`, and `params` are async.
