Run `next build` (through the project's build script) before reporting a change as done, and include any route whose rendering changed between static and dynamic in your report. While iterating, `compile_route` and `get_compilation_issues` on the dev server's `/_next/mcp` endpoint are faster checks, but they do not replace the build.
