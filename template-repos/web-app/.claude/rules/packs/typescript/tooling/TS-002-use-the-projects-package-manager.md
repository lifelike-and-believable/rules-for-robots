title: Use the project's package manager and scripts

rationale: Mixing npm, pnpm, and yarn creates conflicting lockfiles, and calling tools directly skips the project's configured flags.
---
Use the package manager that matches the lockfile (`package-lock.json`: npm, `pnpm-lock.yaml`: pnpm, `yarn.lock`: yarn, `bun.lock`: bun). Run tools through the project's `package.json` scripts where one exists rather than calling them directly.
