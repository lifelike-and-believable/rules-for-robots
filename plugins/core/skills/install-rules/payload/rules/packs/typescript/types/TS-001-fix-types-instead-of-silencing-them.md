title: Fix type errors instead of silencing them

rationale: Casting to any or adding ts-ignore makes the type checker pass while the defect stays, the same pattern as editing a failing test.
---
When the type checker reports an error, fix the types or the code. Do not add `any`, `as unknown as`, non-null assertions (`!`), `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error` to make an error go away. For data from outside the program, type it as `unknown` and narrow it with a schema or type guard. If a suppression is genuinely needed, add a comment giving the reason and mention it in your report.
