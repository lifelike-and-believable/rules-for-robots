title: Run migrations over a direct connection in a gated step
level: SHOULD
scope: pack:node-services
paths: ["**/prisma/**", "**/drizzle/**", "**/migrations/**", "**/*.sql", "**/drizzle.config.*", "**/schema.prisma", "**/db/**"]
verified-by: [review]
targets-failure: data-loss
observed-on: []
rationale: Poolers in transaction mode break migrations, and migrations in the Vercel build command also run on production builds.

Use the direct (unpooled) database URL for migrations and the pooled URL for the application. Apply production migrations in a separate, gated pipeline step, not in the build command.
